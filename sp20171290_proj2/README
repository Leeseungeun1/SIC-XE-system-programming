 Make a SIC/XE machine program that creates a list file and an object file
 from the assembly code 

[How to use this program]
 1. To compile, enter 'make' at the command line.
    Then you will get an execution file, '20171290.out'
 2. To execute the program, enter './20171290.out' at the command line.
	Then you can see 'sicsim>'. Now, you are ready to use the program.
 3. To get an object file 
    (1) Store an asm file in the same directory with the execution file.
	(2) Enter the command 'type assemble_file_name.asm'.
		If the command 'Successfully assemble assemble_file_name.asm' is shown,
		the lst file and obj file are successfully created.
		If not, check the error message shown in the command.
	(3) You can check the text of the lst or obj file by using type command.
		ex) type assemble_file_name.lst  

[How to remove the program]
 Enter 'make clean' at the command line. Be careful that all lst files and obj files are
 removed, too.

[When assembling the given file is failed?]
 1. If you try to assemble the file which extension is not '.asm'.
 2. If there are undefined variables in the asm file.
 3. If the variable name is used several times.
 4. If there are undefined instructions in the asm file.
