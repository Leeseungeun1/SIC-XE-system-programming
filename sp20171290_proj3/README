 Make a SIC/XE machine program that link and load the programs to the memory
using object files

[How to use this program]
 1. To compile, enter 'make' at the command line.
    Then you will get an execution file, '20171290.out'
 2. To execute the program, enter './20171290.out' at the command line.
	Then you can see 'sicsim>'. Now, you are ready to use the program.
 3. Set the program start address
	using 'progaddr', you can set the start address of the program
	ex) progaddr 4000 : set the program start address to 4000(hexa) 
 4. Link and load the program
	using 'loader', you can link and load the programs
	ex) loader prog1 prog2 progb
	* split the program filename with space
	* the format of the program file must be object file.
	If you execute loader, you can check the ESTAB about input programs
 5. Set breakpoints
	using 'bp' command, you can set breakpoints of the loaded program.
 6. Run the program
	using 'run' command, you can execute loaded program.
	If you set breakpoints, then the program will stop at the breakpoint, and
	show the informations of registers.

[How to remove the program]
 Enter 'make clean' at the command line. Be careful that all lst files and obj files are
 removed, too.
